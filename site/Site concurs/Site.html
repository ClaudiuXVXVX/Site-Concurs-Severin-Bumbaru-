                    <h3 class="asdd" style="text-indent: 40px;">The responsibility to raise capable, confident, and easily adaptable children requires patience and tenacity. A critical aspect that is often overlooked is the financial education we need to provide to our children. What is financial intelligence? We have all heard of the intelligence that is measured by IQ, and some of us have heard of the emotional intelligence that helps us succeed in life. But how many of us have heard of financial intelligence and how it helps us become financially responsible adults?</h3>
                    <h3 class="asdd" style="text-indent: 40px;">At present, the school is too little involved in the financial education of our children. That is why this responsibility rests with the family. The sooner we develop our children's financial intelligence, the better start we give them in life. Start with the game. Family games are the most beloved and appreciated activities for children. There are a multitude of board-game options from which you can choose the option that suits you best. Learning through play is the most effective way to educate children.</h3>
                    <h2 class="asd"><b>Tips for a good financial education</b></h2>
                    <h3 class="asdd" style="text-indent: 40px;">• Make parallels between play and real life, so the child will remember the rules when he grows up. </h3>
                    <h3 class="asdd" style="text-indent: 40px;">• Give him a weekly budget. This is how he will learn to differentiate between needs and desires and prioritize needs to fit the budget. If he spends his money before receiving the next amount and wants to make a new purchase, he resists the temptation to give him an advance to teach him how to manage his money and wait for his wishes to be fulfilled.  </h3>
                    <h3 class="asdd" style="text-indent: 40px;">• Encourage him to keep the vouchers for the purchases he made so that he can analyze for himself what he spent the money on and decide if he wants to change something in the management of his finances. School age is the best time to start the child's financial responsibility. At this age he is already familiar with the numbers and it is possible to see in other children, at school, pocket money and thus will integrate into trends. </h3>
                    <h3 class="asdd" style="text-indent: 40px;">• Encourage him to save. Reward him for every penny saved and he will learn to pay on it first. If he learns this from a young age, he will certainly not accept things differently when he grows up. Set a clothing budget together. Make a list of your quarterly clothing needs together and decide together what's left and what's not.  </h3>
                    <h3 class="asdd" style="text-indent: 40px;">• Give him the amount set together and have him bring you the vouchers to make sure the money has met its destination. You can do the same with other categories of expenses. Help him achieve his goals. When the child wants to achieve something that involves financial resources, it is our duty as parents to support him. This does not mean that you have to put the money he needs on the tray, especially if it is a high value project, but you have to motivate him to work with you to achieve the proposed goal. If he manages to raise half of the required amount then you will complete the amount, so you teach him to work for what he wants. Involve him in family projects.  </h3>
                    <h3 class="asdd" style="text-indent: 40px;">• Get him informed for your next high-value purchase and decide together which is the best option. This is how you will make him responsible and at the same time he will feel useful to the family and will learn the value of goods and money. Discuss with him the financial situation of the family. </h3>
