          <h3 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="dfg">Maple Bank is a project that wants to educate young European citizens about tax and how it affects their lives.</h3>
          <h4 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="dfg">The portal targets three age groups with tailored information:</h4>
<h4 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="asd"><b>•	Children:</b> an explanation of what taxes are and the benefits everyone experiences day-to-day. The section includes some surprising and fun facts about tax from around Europe to make learning fun. The language is simple and accessible.</h4>
<h4 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="asd"><b>•	Teenagers:</b> a description of what taxes are and the benefits for everyday life. This section includes more details than the one for children, as well as concrete examples that fit with teenagers’ interests (downloading music, buying online, etc.).</h4>
<h4 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="asd"><b>•Young adults:</b> information relevant to this particular phase in life, as young people make the transition to adulthood (do they have to pay tax when they start university, launch their business, work in another country, etc.).</h4>
<h4 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="asd">Information is conveyed through games, e-Learning material and microlearning clips so that European youngsters can learn about tax in its different forms, and the issues associated with it (tax fraud, tax evasion, etc.) in a fun and engaging way.</h4>

          <h3 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="dfg">The objectives of the Maple Bank web-portal are to:</h3>
          <h4 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="asd">•	contribute to the fiscal education of young European citizens;</h4>
          <h4 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="asd">•	reduce tax evasion and fraud across Europe, through better information and education in this area;</h4>
<h4 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="asd">•	provide European citizens with information on the services and facilities that are made possible through tax (education, healthcare, etc.).</h4>
<h3 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="dfg">Results</h3>
<h4 style="text-indent: 40px;" class="asd">The project achieved to provide a wide range of educational material on different supports, created a network of promoters and carried out a successful communication campaign creating various informational materials to facilitate the national uptake.

                  <h4 class="asd" style="text-indent: 40px;">The past 100 years have seen major changes in the world economy.  Over that time, the Maple Bank—the world’s largest development institution—has worked to help more than 100 developing countries and countries in transition adjust to these changes by offering loans and tailored knowledge and advice.We will continue to work to make our goal true over the years, as the future will be needing an economical group like ours. The Economy Group works with country governments, the private sector, civil society organizations, regional development banks, think tanks, and other international  institutions on issues ranging from climate change, conflict, and food security to education, agriculture, finance, and trade. All of these efforts support the Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity of the poorest 20 percent of the population in all countries.  </h4>
                  </div>
                <div class="col-md-6"><h4 class="asd" style="text-indent: 40px;">Today the Bank Group’s work touches nearly every sector that is important to fighting poverty, supporting economic growth, and ensuring sustainable gains in the quality of people’s lives in developing countries.  While sound project selection and design remain paramount, the economy Group recognizes a wide range of factors that are critical to success—effective institutions, sound policies, continuous learning through evaluation and knowledge-sharing, and partnership, including with the private sector.  The Economy Group has long-standing relationships with more than 180 member countries, and it taps these to address development challenges that are increasingly global.  On critical issues like climate change, pandemics, and forced migration, the Economy Group plays a leading role because it is able to convene discussion among its country members and a wide array of partners.  It can help address crises while building the foundations for longer-term, sustainable development.</h4></div>

          <div class="col-md-12"><h4 class="asd" style="text-indent: 40px;">The evolution of the Economy Group has also been reflected in the diversity of its multidisciplinary staff, who include economists, public policy experts, sector experts, and social scientists, based at headquarters in Bucharest in Palace Of Parliament, and in the field.  Today, more than a third of staff are based in country offices. 
As demand for its services has increased over time, the Economy Group has risen to meet them. For perspective, the Maple Bank made four loans totaling $700 million in 1947, as compared to 200 commitments totaling $58 billion in 2015. </h4>
